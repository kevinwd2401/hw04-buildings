# CIS 5660 HW04 Procedural Buildings

## Project Overview
In this homework you’ll gain more experience with tool creation and loops. The core of this homework will be following a Procedural House tutorial to create a multi-floor building generator. The tutorial is linked here:

## Part 0: Setup and Planning 
### SideFX Labs 
The tutorial requires some nodes from SideFX Labs. If you haven’t already installed it, you can do so at the “Labs/Packages” tab of the Houdini Launcher.

Potential Changes: The alignment, rotation and offsets of the houses stacked upon each other.

Before you begin on this project, skim through the tutorial and then pick a building type/style you’d like to emulate (either from photos or concept art). You should watch the entirety of the tutorial  before committing to a style so you can pick something that is manageable and will be achievable using the techniques in the tutorial.  
Of course, you’re welcome to adapt the setup to support additional logic/features to match your style, and particularly complex additions could merit extra credit :) On the other hand, if you’re newer to Houdini and want to stick relatively close to the tutorial, that’s okay too. Just be sure to think through what changes your chosen buildings will require (additional assets? different placement logic?) before diving into the project so you don’t bite off more than you can chew.  
Make sure the include the reference you select in your README, and don’t forget to credit your sources.  
Here are a few examples of possible building styles that could be a decent fit for inspiration:
